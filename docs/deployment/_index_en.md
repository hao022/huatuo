The HUATUO collector **huatuo-bamai** runs on physical machines or VMs. We provide both binary packages and Docker images, and you can deploy them in any custom way, such as:

- **Systemd** and **DaemonSet** deployments are recommended for production.
- **Docker / Compose** is suitable for development and quick validation scenarios.

## Binary Download

> The latest binary package provided is v2.1.0; the master branch is for reference only.

## Mirror Download

Docker images are stored on Docker Hub by default (https://hub.docker.com/u/huatuo).
